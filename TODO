- coriolis component for particle motion?

- DALES compilation warnings?

- rho(t)? (Bussinesq/compressible):
  - modthermodynamics.f90: 94   rhof(k) = presf(k)/(rd*thvf(k)*exnf(k))
  - rhobf/rhobh is used in advection
  - is rhobf dry?
  - czy rhof-rho_d to rho_v -> r_v?
  - which rho for calculating "paths"

- does theta_l & qt approach assume saturation adjustment?
  - satadj piggybacking vs saturation-dependent scheme?

- how to visualise? (no 3D fields in nc files?)

- what after piggybacking?

- stochastic term for particle motion (f of TKE)

- what happens during spinup? (8 calls to micro before first step?)

- should we call libcloud before or after "call thermodynamics"? (what about precip terms?)
  -> how to generate supersaturation?

- MicroHH

- dt=20s  ->  another way to cope with S needed?

- GPU memory

DALES suggestions:
  - no t=0 output in fielddump
  - why dt is integer?
