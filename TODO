- coriolis component for particle motion?

- DALES compilation warnings?

- rho(t)? (Bussinesq/compressible):
  - modthermodynamics.f90: 94   rhof(k) = presf(k)/(rd*thvf(k)*exnf(k))
  - rhobf used in advection
  - is rhobf dry?

- does theta_l & qt approach assume saturation adjustment?
  - satadj piggybacking vs saturation-dependent scheme?

- how to visualise? (no 3D fields in nc files?)

- what after piggybacking?

- stochastic term for particle motion (f of TKE)

- 8 calls to micro before first step?

DALES suggestions:
  - no t=0 output in fielddump
